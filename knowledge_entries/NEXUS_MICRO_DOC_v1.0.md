# Micro LLMs Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Micro LLMs (Small Language Models or SLMs) are compact, efficient language models designed to deliver AI capabilities with significantly fewer parameters than their larger counterparts. Typically containing fewer than 30 billion parameters, these models are optimized for specific domains or tasks while requiring less computational power, memory, and energy.
