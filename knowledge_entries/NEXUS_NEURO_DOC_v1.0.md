# Neuromorphic Computing Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Neuromorphic computing is a computing paradigm that models hardware and software elements after the structure and function of the human brain and nervous system. It aims to replicate the brain's remarkable efficiency, adaptability, and parallel processing capabilities by using artificial neurons and synapses that communicate through electrical spikes, similar to biological neural systems. Neuromorphic computing represents a fundamental departure from traditional von Neumann computing architectures, offering potential breakthroughs in energy efficiency, real-time processing, and adaptive learning for AI applications.

## Core Principles

### Brain-Inspired Architecture
1. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Computational models where neurons communicate through discrete events (spikes) rather than continuous values
2. **Collocated Processing and Memory**: Integration of computation and storage in the same physical location, eliminating the von Neumann bottleneck
3. **Massively Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous operation of millions of simple processing units (neurons) working together
4. **Event-Driven Computation**: Computing resources activated only when needed, based on incoming spikes, dramatically reducing power consumption

### Biological Foundations
1. **Neurons as Computational Units**: Artificial neurons that integrate inputs and generate spikes when thresholds are exceeded
2. **Synaptic Plasticity**: Dynamic adjustment of connection strengths between neurons based on activity patterns
