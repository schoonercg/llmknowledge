# Hybrid Computing Systems Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview

Hybrid Computing Systems refer to computational architectures that integrate different computing paradigms to leverage their complementary strengths while mitigating their individual limitations. In the current technological landscape, the most prominent hybrid computing approach involves the integration of quantum and classical computing systems. This hybrid quantum-classical architecture combines the massive parallelism and unique problem-solving capabilities of quantum processors with the reliability, accessibility, and established software ecosystems of classical high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

Hybrid computing represents a pragmatic approach to harnessing quantum advantages in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, where quantum computers remain limited by qubit counts, coherence times, and error rates. By distributing computational workloads optimally between quantum and classical resources, hybrid systems can tackle complex problems that would be intractable for either computing paradigm alone, while providing a practical pathway toward quantum advantage in real-world applications.
