# Spatial Computing Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Spatial computing is a technology paradigm that enables computers to perceive, understand, and interact with the three-dimensional physical world. It merges the digital and physical realms by allowing digital content to exist within and respond to real-world spaces. Unlike traditional computing that operates primarily through 2D interfaces, spatial computing creates immersive experiences where virtual objects can be placed in physical environments, understood in their spatial context, and manipulated through natural human movements. This technology represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction, moving beyond screens to create intuitive, contextual, and spatially aware computing experiences.
