# Platform Engineering Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Platform engineering is the practice of building and maintaining internal software platforms that enable development teams to self-service their infrastructure and tooling needs. It focuses on creating a unified, standardized environment that abstracts away the complexity of underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing deployment environments. Platform engineering emerged as a response to the increasing complexity of modern software development ecosystems, where teams must navigate numerous tools, services, and infrastructure components.

## Core Principles

### Self-Service Capabilities
1. **Developer Autonomy**: Empowering developers to provision and manage resources independently
2. **Reduced Wait Times**: Eliminating bottlenecks by removing dependencies on operations teams
3. **Standardized Access**: Providing consistent interfaces for accessing tools and services
4. **On-Demand Resources**: Enabling immediate access to development environments and infrastructure

### Automation First
1. **Workflow Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks across the software development lifecycle
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Streamlining continuous integration and deployment pipelines
4. **Automated Governance**: Enforcing policies and compliance through automated checks

### Developer Experience (DevEx)
1. **Intuitive Interfaces**: Creating user-friendly portals and APIs for platform interaction
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Abstracting complexity to simplify developer workflows
3. **Consistent Workflows**: Providing standardized patterns for common development tasks
4. **Feedback Loops**: Continuously improving based on developer input and usage metrics

### Scalability and Reliability
1. **Elastic Infrastructure**: Designing systems that can scale with organizational growth
2. **High Availability**: Ensuring platform services remain accessible and responsive
3. **Observability**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring and logging
