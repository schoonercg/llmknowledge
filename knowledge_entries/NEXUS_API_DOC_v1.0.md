# Azure API Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Azure API Management (APIM) is a hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments. As a platform-as-a-service (PaaS), it supports the complete API lifecycle, enabling organizations to create, secure, publish, monitor, and analyze APIs. Azure API Management helps organizations expose their services as well-designed, documented, and secure APIs for consumption by internal teams, partners, and public developers.
