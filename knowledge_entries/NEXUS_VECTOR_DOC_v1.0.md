# Vector Search for Retrieval Augmented Generation Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview

Vector Search for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a foundational technology that enables AI systems to retrieve and incorporate relevant information from external knowledge sources during text generation. Unlike traditional language models that rely solely on their pre-trained parameters, RAG systems use vector search to dynamically access and integrate contextually appropriate information, enhancing the accuracy, relevance, and factual grounding of AI-generated responses.

At its core, vector search transforms text into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning, allowing for retrieval based on conceptual similarity rather than exact keyword matching. This semantic understanding enables RAG systems to find relevant information even when queries and documents use different terminology to express similar concepts.

RAG represents a paradigm shift in AI capabilities by addressing key limitations of traditional language models, including:

1. **Knowledge cutoff limitations** - Providing access to up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
2. **Domain-specific expertise** - Enabling specialized knowledge retrieval for vertical applications
3. **Factual accuracy** - Grounding responses in verifiable external sources
4. **Transparency** - Creating clear links between generated content and source materials

## Core Components and Architecture
