# Post-Quantum Cryptography Knowledge Entry

## Definition and Overview
Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), also called quantum-resistant cryptography, refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against attacks from both classical computers and quantum computers. These algorithms aim to protect sensitive data and communications from the threat posed by quantum computers, which could potentially break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. Post-quantum cryptography is essential for ensuring the long-term security of digital information as quantum computing technology advances.

## The Quantum Threat

### Quantum Computing Fundamentals
1. **Quantum Bits (Qubits)**: Unlike classical bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition
2. **Quantum Parallelism**: Ability to process vast numbers of possibilities simultaneously
3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Correlation between qubits that enables complex computations
4. **Quantum Interference**: Manipulation of probability amplitudes to increase likelihood of correct answers

### Vulnerability of Current Cryptography
1. **RSA and ECC Vulnerability**: Quantum computers using Shor's algorithm could efficiently factor large numbers and compute discrete logarithms
2. **Timeline Estimates**: Many experts predict cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge within 10-20 years
3. **"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"**: Adversaries collecting encrypted data today to decrypt when quantum computers become available
4. **Critical Infrastructure Risk**: Financial systems, healthcare records, and national security communications all at risk
